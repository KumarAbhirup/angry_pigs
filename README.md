# Dodge Game

A simple game based on avoiding incoming objects! You get points for every enemy that gets to the bottom of the screen! How long can you last?

## Getting Started
Main code is in *frontend/app/index.js*

I've provided comments in the most important parts of the code, so you don't get lost. 

Feel free to modify anything, upgrade the game, add more stuff!
